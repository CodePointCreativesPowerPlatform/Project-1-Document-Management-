# Document Management System (DMS)

## Overview
The Document Management System (DMS) is a robust system designed to efficiently organize, control, and manage documents within an organization. It focuses on features such as document organization, version control, approval workflows, metadata management, user access, security, and automation.

## Features
## Automation  

1. Automated Approval Flow: When a new file is added to the document library, an automated flow is triggered. It sends an approval request and updates the document's status to either "rejected" or "approved" based on the response received.
   - If the document is rejected, it is moved to another folder.
2. Automatic Deletion of Rejected Files: Another automation is in place to check whether the files in the rejected folder have been there for more than seven days. If so, the automation deletes those files.

 ### User Permissions for Reading and Editing
User access and security are essential aspects of a DMS:

- Permissions: The system allows setting appropriate permissions for user groups, controlling access to documents and functionalities. Permissions can include read access, write access, delete access, upload access, and manage permissions.
- User Groups: 
Users can be divided into groups based on their roles and responsibilities, ensuring appropriate access rights.

To enhanceuser access control, the DMS includes the ability to assign specific permissions for reading and editing documents. This feature ensures that only authorized individuals can view and modify documents based on their assigned roles and responsibilities.
