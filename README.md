# About The Project 
I'm working on a project called the Document Management System. It helps store documents, and when a new document is created, the system automatically sends an email to the owner. If the document is approved, it gets stored. If it's rejected, it goes to a reject folder. If neither approval nor rejection happens, the system sends reminders via email for three consecutive days.
